# Build a Personal Portfolio Page

[--> See it live.](https://superjoshua.github.io/fcc-portfolio-page/)

This was a project required for getting the Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodeCamp. It required the fulfillment of these "user stories". This one has certainly been overridden by [my actual portfolio page](https://superjoshua.github.io/)

- Your portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section
- The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text
- Your portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects
- The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project
- The projects section should contain at least one link to a project
- Your portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar
- The navbar should contain at least one link that you can click on to navigate to different sections of the page
- Your portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens your GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab
- Your portfolio should have at least one media query
- The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport
- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport

It also had to pass these tests.

- Your #welcome-section element should contain an h1 element.
- You should not have any empty h1 elements within #welcome-section element.
